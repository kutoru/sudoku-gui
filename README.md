# What is this?
This is my attempt at writing a GUI application with C++.\
In the past I wrote a few small CLI Sudoku apps, but this time I wanted to try making a GUI app with some user authorization elements.\
This project is entirely based on WinForms.\
I also wanted to learn how C++ can interact with databases, so I also used MySQL here.

# Project status
The project is done but I am currently in the process of tidying up the code...
